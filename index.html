        <p>There appears to be a concerning misconception that Bitcoin is somehow
anonymous, and it is the best payment method for those
wanting to protect their privacy and anonymity. Well, it may surprise you,
but Bitcoin is not anonymous. It never was. </p>

<p>Seeing how this misconception is prevalent with Bitcoiners and 
services accepting this cryptocurrency,
the following list of quotes regarding 
Bitcoin's anonymity and privacy was prepared.</p>

<p>The quotes, as being mostly short extracts of text from the linked sources,
can often be taken out of context. So it is advised to checked the linked
 resources from which the quotes were taken to get complete
 information. </p>
 
 </p>The primary aim of this page is
 to aggregate these links and quotes in one place. The secondary aim is to get you started thinking and doing your own research on Bitcoin's limitations in terms of
  privacy and anonymity.</p>

<p>The list starts with the official links and quotes from
 bitcoin.org. Then quotes from <a href="#other-sources-chronological-order">
 other sources</a> are provided.  Finally links to  <a href="#possible-solutions">possible solutions</a> to this problem are given.</p>

Since <a href="/fungibility.html">fungibility</a> of Bitcoin is directly related to its  privacy and anonimity, also few links and quotes regarding this topic  can be found <a href="/fungibility.html">here</a>.

<p>This means that it is not anonymous. In fact, it is rather pseudonymous. This means that the bitcoin address of a user is similar to that of an account number. Therefore, it is possible to connect the user to an address and trace all the transactions.</p>
<p>Moreover, advanced and improved techniques to connect bitcoin addresses and users, analyze transaction patterns, mine data from the social media as well as other public sources and analyze IP addresses are already available. </p>
<p>Therefore, the attribution advantage offered by bitcoin is searchability, traceability and the blockchain’s permanence. </p>

<p>If you ask the average person what words come to mind when they think of bitcoin, three of the most common responses will likely be "anonymous", "untraceable" and "a currency for criminals." But all of these common ideas about bitcoin are actually misconceptions. In fact, every single one of them is wrong.</p>

<p>As all Bitcoin transactions are a matter of public record, any address which becomes associated with your identity and / or enterprise reveals 4 important pieces of information: 1) How many bitcoins you held or hold within that address, 2) Exactly when you received those bitcoins, 3) Who you received those bitcoins from (unless they employ effective privacy methods) 4) The next address to which you send those bitcoins (which, as with 3, may identify its owner).</p>

Depending on how much trouble you want to go to, and whom you trust, and how you’re defining “anonymous” at the moment. And how often you plan to use Bitcoin. I’m not going to argue against the possibility, though I do think it’s a hell of a lot of work to achieve anonymity this way.</p>
<p>I’d really prefer to use a currency with more
built-in support for anonymity.</p>
<p>For most readers, for today, I just want to say: do not assume your Bitcoin transactions are in any sense anonymous, unless you’re willing to dive into the technologies involved and become an expert on the topic, including digital-security issues not directly related to Bitcoin itself (bright side: this book ought to help quite a bit).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly, there are hundreds of ways a Bitcoin transaction can be linked to someone’s real identity. True pseudonymity against a resourceful adversary is very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Over the course of just a few months, you could come into contact with hundreds of Bitcoin addresses. It is often only necessary to associate just one of these addresses with your real identity to work out your real identity.</p>
<p>Each Bitcoin transaction contains at least one input (where the Bitcoins are from) and at least one output (where the Bitcoins are being sent). This means that once a single address is known, there is a trail to follow the Bitcoins.</p>
<p>Your real name might be connected to a Bitcoin transaction when you make transactions with Bitcoin, for example, if you buy goods online and have them shipped to your real address. </p>
<p>Bitcoin exchanges and even some ATMs often require you to show identification before making a purchase.</p>
<p>When you buy bitcoins from someone in person, they might know who you are and keep a record of the transaction. This record could fall into the hands of your adversary, or maybe even be made public.</p>
<p>Your country’s anti-money laundering laws might require you to reveal your identity when buying or selling Bitcoin, making it necessary to obfuscate their trail on the blockchain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unfortunate side effect [of the Bitcoin ledger] is that all the transaction data must be conspicuously public so it can be verified, which is at odds with the normal expectation of privacy for traditional monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Insufficient financial privacy can have serious security and privacy implications for both commercial and personal transactions.</p>
<p>Insufficient privacy can also result in a loss of fungibility–where some coins are treated as more acceptable than others–which would further undermine Bitcoin’s utility as money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin partially addresses the privacy problem by using pseudonymous addresses. If someone does not know which users own which addresses, the privacy impact is reduced. But any time you transact with someone you learn at least one of their addresses. From there, you can trace out other connected addresses and estimate the values of their transactions and holdings.</p>

<p>True anonymity in Bitcoin is only a myth, currently</p>
<p>There is full visibility of all transactions.</p>
<p>Blockchain analysis, as a relatively new market sector within Bitcoin, demonstrates the weakness of pseudonymity.</p>
<p>True financial privacy doesn't exist on the Bitcoin blockchain. Without a redesign, this should be a serious concern.</p>
<p>Blockchain analysis techniques can only improve. It's believed that huge swathes of addresses could be de-anonymized over time. It doesn’t take much to put everything together once you have a few pieces of the puzzle. This would leave a complete history of your financial information publically available, forever.</p>

<p>While the ownership of the wallets is anonymous, the ledger is public.</p>

  Consequently, unlike paper currency, which can disappear and
   reappear with no record of transfer or trace of exchange, every
    single Bitcoin transaction is available for all the world to see
     and cannot be hidden, or obscured or changed.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin does not instantly reveal who
 owns the accounts on either end (the wallets),

<p>Many people are drawn to Bitcoin and virtual currencies for the
 illusion of being able to move funds around in an
  anonymous way. However, with the blockchain acting
   as a transparent ledger, there is no such
    thing as anonymity in the Bitcoin space.</p>

<p>most people see the virtual currency as a safe haven
 for money laundering, fraud, and illegal trading.
 Such a train of thought is quite odd, as Bitcoin
 is not anonymous and is one of the worst possible
 options to launder money.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions are not truly anonymous.</p>

<p>A full transaction record of every Bitcoin and every Bitcoin user’s
 encrypted identity is maintained on the public ledger.</p>

<p>Because of the public ledger, researchers have found that,
using sophisticated computer analysis, transactions
 involving large quantities of Bitcoin can be tracked
  and claim that if paired with current law enforcement tools it
   would be possible to gain a lot of information on the persons
moving the Bitcoins.</p>

<p>Bitcoin exchanges will be required to collect
personal data on their customers, limiting further the system’s
 ability to maintain the user’s pseudonymity.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions do not have the anonymity afforded by
 cash transactions, as there is a permanent and complete historical
 record of Bitcoin amounts and encrypted identities for all
 transactions on the Bitcoin system that are potentially traceable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unfortunate side effect [of the Bitcoin ledger] is that all the transaction data must be conspicuously public so it can be verified, which is at odds with the
normal expectation of privacy for traditional monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Insufficient financial privacy can have serious security and privacy
implications for both commercial and personal transactions. Without
adequate protection, thieves and scammers can focus their efforts on
known high-value targets, competitors can learn business details, and
negotiating positions can be undermined. Since publishing often requires
spending money, lack of privacy can chill free speech.  Insufficient
privacy can also result in a loss of fungibility--where some coins are
treated as more acceptable than others--which would further undermine
Bitcoin's utility as money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin partially addresses the privacy problem by using pseudonymous
addresses. If someone does not know which users own which addresses,
the privacy impact is reduced. But any time you transact with someone
you learn at least one of their addresses. From there, you can trace out
other connected addresses and estimate the values of their transactions
and holdings.</p>
<p>For example, suppose your employer pays you with Bitcoin
and you later spend those coins on your rent and groceries. Your landlord
and the supermarket will both learn your income, and could charge you
higher prices as your income changes or target you for theft.</p>
<p>There are existing deployed techniques that further improve privacy
in Bitcoin (such as CoinJoin, which merges the transaction history of
users by making joint payments), but the utility of these techniques is
reduced by the fact that it's possible to track amounts.</p>

<p>Compared to traditional illegal drug and weapons sales,
 the use of Bitcoin is complex and potentially riskier because

<p>Once an investigator links a user’s identity to his Bitcoin address,
 he can look up the current balance of that address and track both

<blockquote>
<p>Blockstream Co-Founder and Bitcoin Core Developer Greg Maxwell mentioned
how he wouldn’t want to live in a bitcoin world if privacy were not improved.</p>

<p>Once you pay someone, they know who you are because you transacted with them.
 They can look at your transaction history to make a good guess at what your
 financial history is. You can leak this information to everyone, and
 they just have to attach your name to one address [to] get all of the other details.</p>

<p>When we ask institutions about using bitcoin, even the
 most boring institutions look at this
 and say, "We don’t want to use all of our transactions in public."</p>

<p>In many instances, the financial privacy of the legacy
  banking system is preferred over bitcoin.</p>

<p>When dealing with a centralized financial institution, one’s transaction history
is at least kept private (in theory) from everyone other than the bank and the customer.</p>

<p>And a loss of privacy loses fungibility, and that’s an
inherent property of money. If each bitcoin has a history
 and people know how it’s used, then maybe some people won’t want some bitcoin</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the anonymity is not as good as one would think.</p>

<p>Satoshi Nakamoto did not focus on anonymity, though,
when the whitepaper was written. [..]
Keeping transactions private was never the primary aim.</p>

<p>I for example do not feel comfortable when I look at services in the internet,
 which advertise absolute anonymity and brag with bitcoin from
  allegedly untraceable sources like onionland.</p>

<p>One should be careful, though, when using services in the internet,
 which claim to anonymize coins.</p>

<p>The blockchain does not forget. One of its shortcomings when it comes to privacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin community has identified many of the risks inherent in coupling a degree of anonymity with the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions. Unfortunately, the partial solutions which have emerged to address those risks [...] do little to address what is, for many users, a significantly higher priority. That higher priority is privacy.</p>
<p>Ironically, however, preoccupation with anonymity, and especially the makeshift solutions designed to address problems which anonymity creates, risk making privacy in the Bitcoin economy worse, rather than better.</p>
<p>Advocating for privacy does not and should not require advocating that Bitcoin users hide their identities.</p>
<p>Bitcoin transactions are themselves a matter of public record, and network analysis tools can trace the ongoing flow of specific units of currency through transactions involving new addresses.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s public record of transactions makes violations of privacy even more of a potential liability than in most other methods of transacting monetary value. </p>
<p>Once the buyer provides personally identifying information to the merchant, the status of that person’s privacy, including the link between them and the publicly visible transaction, becomes dependent upon the subsequent actions of the merchant. That person’s privacy also potentially affects the privacy of all the other individuals using that specific Bitcoin, by providing what amounts to an identifiable anchor point for analysis of the Bitcoin network flow.</p>
<p> Relying on the degree of anonymity provided by the protocol itself offers an entirely false sense of security when it comes to your privacy: once information leakage occurs, it leaks big time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technically the appropriate term is "pseudonymous" - imagine that your bitcoin address is like an email address
or an online alias: how hard it is to trace to your actions depend largely on what you do with it.</p>

<p>It is considered pseudo-anonymous. With casual usage, it is not very anonymous at all.</p>

<p>Bitcoin transactions can be traced back to your IP address.
 The history of all transactions can be analyzed for spatial and
  temporal correlations. If one address can be linked to a person,
   then related transactions can be identified.</p>

<p>And, you have to know what you're doing to use
 it in complete anonymity. I would not advise using bitcoin if
  you are seeking complete anonymity.</p>

<p>But untraceable transactions are not an inherent part of Bitcoin at
 this point, and given the architecture of the system
  they will probably never be, regardless of the importance
   the community puts on anonymity.</p>

<p>There’s a common myth that Bitcoin is anonymous.</p>

<p>Because your transactions can be linked together, some prefer
 to say that Bitcoin is at best pseudonymous.</p>

<p>It’s possible for an investigator to put together enough information to get a decent idea of who you’re involved with and what you’re interested in buying, particularly if you’ve been involved in transactions with others who have made their Bitcoin address public.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who use Bitcoin to ensure their purchases remain anonymous
may want to reconsider their reliance on the online peer-to-peer currency,
 say researchers who have investigated the network of Bitcoin transactions.</p>

<p>Anyone can view every transaction, but since there is no public record linking
 addresses to users and users can have any number of addresses many
  people assumed it would not be possible to trace transactions to
   a particular individual. Now Fergal Reid and Martin Harrigan of University College Dublin,
    Ireland, say this assumption is wrong.</p>

<p>most casual users of Bitcoin may not be anonymous, even though many
 of them may believe they are.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not without its flaws.</p>

<p>Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's primary developers,
has repeatedly told journalists: "Attempting major illicit transactions
 with Bitcoin, given existing statistical analysis
 techniques deployed in the field by law enforcement,
  is pretty damned dumb."</p>

<p>The first is that the media often say that Bitcoin is anonymous,
 and I would say that anyone that works in the
  development of Bitcoin would agree that these reports are wrong.</p>

<p>So it has this worrisome property that later
transactions can give you information about
the identity of the people that performed the earlier transactions.</p>

<p>Jeff Garzik, a member of the Bitcoin core development team, says in an email that bitcoin is not as anonymous as the denizens of Silk Road would like to believe. He explains that because all Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public log, though the identities of all the parties are anonymous, law enforcement could use sophisticated network analysis techniques to parse the transaction flow and track down individual Bitcoin users.

better than using a credit card,

 anonymity without a lot of changes.</p>

 Anyone can see the flow of BitCoins from address to address. This becomes a problem

<p>The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous
relies on you not revealing any identifying information
about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.</p>

<p>If you post your bitcoin address on the web,
 then you're associating that address and any transactions
 with it with the name you posted under.
  If you posted under a handle that you haven't
