        <p>There appears to be a concerning misconception that Bitcoin is somehow
anonymous, and it is the best payment method for those
wanting to protect their privacy and anonymity. Well, it may surprise you,
but Bitcoin is not anonymous. It never was. </p>

<p>Seeing how this misconception is prevalent with Bitcoiners and 
services accepting this cryptocurrency,
the following list of quotes regarding 
Bitcoin's anonymity and privacy was prepared.</p>

<p>The quotes, as being mostly short extracts of text from the linked sources,
can often be taken out of context. So it is advised to checked the linked
 resources from which the quotes were taken to get complete
 information. </p>
 
 </p>The primary aim of this page is
 to aggregate these links and quotes in one place. The secondary aim is to get you started thinking and doing your own research on Bitcoin's limitations in terms of
  privacy and anonymity.</p>

<p>The list starts with the official links and quotes from
 bitcoin.org. Then quotes from <a href="#other-sources-chronological-order">
 other sources</a> are provided.
 Finally links to
 <a href="#possible-solutions">possible solutions</a> to this problem are given.</p>

<p>The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the
parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.</p>

<p>The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not anonymous, but, rather, pseudo-anonymous.</p>
<p>all transactions over the Bitcoin network are completely transparent and traceable by anyone. It’s typically this complete transparency that allows multiple Bitcoin addresses to be clustered together, and be tied to the same user. Therefore, if just one of these clustered addresses is linked to a real-world identity through one or several of the other de-anonymizing methods, all clustered addresses can be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is more susceptible to tracing than paper money.</p>

<p>While the ownership of the wallets is anonymous, the ledger is public.</p>

<p>This ledger has a full and easily viewable history of all transactions
 that have ever occurred and will ever occur on the Bitcoin network.
  Consequently, unlike paper currency, which can disappear and
   reappear with no record of transfer or trace of exchange, every
    single Bitcoin transaction is available for all the world to see
     and cannot be hidden, or obscured or changed.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin does not instantly reveal who
 owns the accounts on either end (the wallets),
  the transactions are recorded, and recorded on a very public ledger.</p>

<p>Consequently, contrary to what many people believe
law enforcement is in a better position when criminals use Bitcoin
 than they are when criminals use paper currency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unfortunate side effect [of the Bitcoin ledger] is that all the transaction data must be conspicuously public so it can be verified, which is at odds with the
normal expectation of privacy for traditional monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Insufficient financial privacy can have serious security and privacy
implications for both commercial and personal transactions. Without
adequate protection, thieves and scammers can focus their efforts on
known high-value targets, competitors can learn business details, and
negotiating positions can be undermined. Since publishing often requires
spending money, lack of privacy can chill free speech.  Insufficient
privacy can also result in a loss of fungibility--where some coins are
treated as more acceptable than others--which would further undermine
Bitcoin's utility as money.</p>
<p>Bitcoin partially addresses the privacy problem by using pseudonymous
addresses. If someone does not know which users own which addresses,
the privacy impact is reduced. But any time you transact with someone
you learn at least one of their addresses. From there, you can trace out
other connected addresses and estimate the values of their transactions
and holdings.</p>
<p>For example, suppose your employer pays you with Bitcoin
and you later spend those coins on your rent and groceries. Your landlord
and the supermarket will both learn your income, and could charge you
higher prices as your income changes or target you for theft.</p>
<p>There are existing deployed techniques that further improve privacy
in Bitcoin (such as CoinJoin, which merges the transaction history of
users by making joint payments), but the utility of these techniques is
reduced by the fact that it's possible to track amounts.</p>

<p>By studying Bitcoin’s public ledger cybercrime specialists can track
the history of every fraction of bitcoin,

 as it passes from one Bitcoin address to another.
 Even the most clever hackers eventually make mistakes.</p>

<p>Compared to traditional illegal drug and weapons sales,
 the use of Bitcoin is complex and potentially riskier because
 of this permanent, public trail.</p>

<p>Once an investigator links a user’s identity to his Bitcoin address,
 he can look up the current balance of that address and track both
  the source as well as the eventual destination address of
   all bitcoins that have ever passed through that one user’s account.</p>

<p>The world is slowly catching on to the fact that the digital
 currency revolution may not be about anonymity as much as transparency,

<blockquote>
<p>Blockstream Co-Founder and Bitcoin Core Developer Greg Maxwell mentioned
how he wouldn’t want to live in a bitcoin world if privacy were not improved.</p>

<p>Once you pay someone, they know who you are because you transacted with them.
 They can look at your transaction history to make a good guess at what your
 financial history is. You can leak this information to everyone, and
 they just have to attach your name to one address [to] get all of the other details.</p>

<p>When we ask institutions about using bitcoin, even the
 most boring institutions look at this
 and say, "We don’t want to use all of our transactions in public."</p>

<p>In many instances, the financial privacy of the legacy
  banking system is preferred over bitcoin.</p>

<p>When dealing with a centralized financial institution, one’s transaction history
is at least kept private (in theory) from everyone other than the bank and the customer.</p>

<p>And a loss of privacy loses fungibility, and that’s an
inherent property of money. If each bitcoin has a history
 and people know how it’s used, then maybe some people won’t want some bitcoin</p>

<p>federal investigators have been able to use Bitcoin’s public ledger (the blockchain) to easily trace bitcoins from Silk Road straight to the charged agents.</p>

<p>every transaction performed with bitcoin is visible on the distributed electronic public ledger known as the blockchain.” Given this traceability, investigators can easily “follow the money.”</p>

If you have this pseudonymous profile, its pretty fragile, its very easy

 they make a purchase is basically an admittance from most
  governments that there is no such thing as financial privacy.
   This was one of the main reasons that Satoshi Nakamoto created

<p>In current practice, a Bitcoin wallet is not totally anonymous, as most of the Bitcoin exchanges are required by governments to provide
real-world identification when trying to cash out from the system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As bitcoins enter the stream of commerce, we should all consider
 the privacy implications associated with the use of bitcoins in commercial transactions.</p>

<p>Until recently, the public nature of the block chain has not
 raised many privacy concerns since the identities of the parties
  on either side of any given transaction are not publicly known.</p>

<p>However, the possibility exists that businesses might create
 “bitcoin identification networks” modeled after our current third-party ad networks.</p>

<p>Two anonymous activists have proposed an alternative to Bitcoin,
 which would fork the protocol to retain more anonymity for users.</p>

<p>The authors also worry that bitcoins used in merchant transactions can
 already be traced back to the exchange where the coins were purchased.</p>

<p>Garzik argues that these features are not needed.
“A corporation that wishes for its finances to be auditable by the world
 at large will not want these proposed anonymity features,” he says,
  adding that pro-anonymity tools and services can be
   layered on top of the protocol. “Wouldn't it be wonderful if
    major corporations or governments published completely open, transparent, auditable,
     cryptographically proven accounting? Bitcoin technology enables that.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin community has identified many of the risks inherent in coupling a degree of anonymity with the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions. Unfortunately, the partial solutions which have emerged to address those risks [...] do little to address what is, for many users, a significantly higher priority. That higher priority is privacy.</p>
<p>Ironically, however, preoccupation with anonymity, and especially the makeshift solutions designed to address problems which anonymity creates, risk making privacy in the Bitcoin economy worse, rather than better.</p>
<p>Advocating for privacy does not and should not require advocating that Bitcoin users hide their identities.</p>
<p>Bitcoin transactions are themselves a matter of public record, and network analysis tools can trace the ongoing flow of specific units of currency through transactions involving new addresses.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s public record of transactions makes violations of privacy even more of a potential liability than in most other methods of transacting monetary value. </p>
<p>Once the buyer provides personally identifying information to the merchant, the status of that person’s privacy, including the link between them and the publicly visible transaction, becomes dependent upon the subsequent actions of the merchant. That person’s privacy also potentially affects the privacy of all the other individuals using that specific Bitcoin, by providing what amounts to an identifiable anchor point for analysis of the Bitcoin network flow.</p>
<p> Relying on the degree of anonymity provided by the protocol itself offers an entirely false sense of security when it comes to your privacy: once information leakage occurs, it leaks big time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin addresses contain no personal information attached to it, and are somewhat anonymous.
However, it is still possible to track a user using transaction history, which is public to all users.</p>

<p>If an address is connected to a user, it is possible to trace the series of transactions, and subsequently, track the user.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeff Garzik, a member of the Bitcoin core development team, says in an email that bitcoin is not as anonymous as the denizens of Silk Road would like to believe. He explains that because all Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public log, though the identities of all the parties are anonymous, law enforcement could use sophisticated network analysis techniques to parse the transaction flow and track down individual Bitcoin users.

<blockquote>
<p>The current BitCoin implementation is certainly
better than using a credit card,
but I wouldn't use it in environments requiring strong
 anonymity without a lot of changes.</p>

<p>The history of a coin is publicly available.
 Anyone can see the flow of BitCoins from address to address. This becomes a problem
  when certain points in the "transaction chain"
   become known to the attacker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous
relies on you not revealing any identifying information
about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.</p>

<p>If you post your bitcoin address on the web,
 then you're associating that address and any transactions
 with it with the name you posted under.
  If you posted under a handle that you haven't
   associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.</p>
