<a id="what-is-fungibility" class="anchor" href="#what-is-fungibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is fungibility</h2>

<p>Fungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. That is, it is the property of essences or goods which are "capable of being substituted in place of one another." For example, since one ounce of pure gold is equivalent to any other ounce of pure gold, gold is fungible. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility">wikipedia</a></p>

<p>In direct link to Bitcoin's <a href="/">privacy and anonomity</a> is fungibility. In short, fungibility "is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. This means that each individual bitcoin should be as good as any other. Unfortunaly, Bitcoin is not fully fungible, which results in individual Bitcoins being different from each other.

<p>Are bitcoins fungible?</p>
<p>No, not really. Each bitcoin has a history associated with it, a log of all previous transactions, that anyone can see on the public ledger (it’s not easy to understand, lots of hashes and codes, but it’s there if you want to take a look).</p>
<p>Since it’s very unlikely that any two histories are the same, this makes each bitcoin unique. </p>
